# Track creation and statistics calculation module for building Track records from GPS points.
#
# This module provides the core functionality for converting arrays of GPS points into
# Track database records with calculated statistics including distance, duration, speed,
# and elevation metrics.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Takes an array of Point objects representing a track segment
# 2. Creates a Track record with basic temporal and spatial boundaries
# 3. Calculates comprehensive statistics: distance, duration, average speed
# 4. Computes elevation metrics: gain, loss, maximum, minimum
# 5. Builds a LineString path representation for mapping
# 6. Associates all points with the created track
#
# Statistics calculated:
# - Distance: Always stored in meters as integers for consistency
# - Duration: Total time in seconds between first and last point
# - Average speed: In km/h regardless of user's distance unit preference
# - Elevation gain/loss: Cumulative ascent and descent in meters
# - Elevation max/min: Highest and lowest altitudes in the track
#
# Distance is converted to user's preferred unit only at display time, not storage time.
# This ensures consistency when users change their distance unit preferences.
#
# Used by:
# - Tracks::Generator for creating tracks during generation
# - Any class that needs to convert point arrays to Track records
#
# Example usage:
#   class MyTrackProcessor
#     include Tracks::TrackBuilder
#
#     def initialize(user)
#       @user = user
#     end
#
#     def process_segment(points)
#       track = create_track_from_points(points)
#       # Track now exists with calculated statistics
#     end
