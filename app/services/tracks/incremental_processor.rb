# frozen_string_literal: true

# This service analyzes new points as they're created and determines whether
# they should trigger incremental track generation based on time and distance
# thresholds defined in user settings.
#
# The key insight is that we should trigger track generation when there's a
# significant gap between the new point and the previous point, indicating
# the end of a journey and the start of a new one.
#
# Process:
# 1. Check if the new point should trigger processing (skip imported points)
# 2. Find the last point before the new point
# 3. Calculate time and distance differences
# 4. If thresholds are exceeded, trigger incremental generation
# 5. Set the end_at time to the previous point's timestamp for track finalization
#
# This ensures tracks are properly finalized when journeys end, not when they start.
#
# Usage:
#   # In Point model after_create_commit callback
#   Tracks::IncrementalProcessor.new(user, new_point).call
#
