# Track segmentation logic for splitting GPS points into meaningful track segments.
#
# This module provides the core algorithm for determining where one track ends
# and another begins, based on time gaps and distance jumps between consecutive points.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Analyzes consecutive GPS points to detect gaps that indicate separate journeys
# 2. Uses configurable time and distance thresholds to identify segment boundaries
# 3. Splits large arrays of points into smaller arrays representing individual tracks
# 4. Provides utilities for handling both Point objects and hash representations
#
# Segmentation criteria:
# - Time threshold: Gap longer than X minutes indicates a new track
# - Distance threshold: Jump larger than X meters indicates a new track
# - Minimum segment size: Segments must have at least 2 points to form a track
#
# The module is designed to be included in classes that need segmentation logic
# and requires the including class to implement distance_threshold_meters and
# time_threshold_minutes methods.
#
# Used by:
# - Tracks::Generator for splitting points during track generation
# - Tracks::CreateFromPoints for legacy compatibility
#
# Example usage:
#   class MyTrackProcessor
#     include Tracks::Segmentation
#
#     def distance_threshold_meters; 500; end
#     def time_threshold_minutes; 60; end
#
#     def process_points(points)
#       segments = split_points_into_segments(points)
#       # Process each segment...
#     end
#   end
