Your data history is filling up

Hi <%= @user.email %>, this is Evgenii from Dawarich.

Heads up: Your oldest location data will be archived in about 2 weeks.

On the Lite plan, your most recent 12 months of data remain fully searchable and interactive. Older data is archived — it stays visible on your map at reduced opacity and can always be exported, but it won't appear in search, stats, or timeline replay.

Upgrade to Pro to keep your full history:
- Unlimited searchable history — every month, every year
- Heatmap, Fog of War, and Globe view
- Full Write API access
- Immich and PhotoPrism integrations

Upgrade now: https://dawarich.app/pricing

Your data is always yours — Pro simply makes all of it searchable and interactive in-app.

Questions? Drop me a message at hi@dawarich.app or just reply to this email.

Best regards,
Evgenii from Dawarich
