üìç Your Location Data is Waiting

Hi <%= @user.email %>, this is Evgenii from Dawarich.

It's been a week since your Dawarich trial ended.

Your location data is still safely stored and patiently waiting for you to return. I understand that choosing the right tool for your location tracking needs is important, and I wanted to reach out one more time.

üó∫Ô∏è Here's what's waiting for you:
- All your location data, preserved and ready
- Reliving your travels through detailed maps and insights
- Privacy-first approach ‚Äì your data stays yours
- Beautiful visualizations of your travel patterns
- Integration with popular location apps and services
- Regular updates and new features

Return to Dawarich: https://my.dawarich.app

This is my final reminder about your trial. If Dawarich isn't the right fit for you right now, I completely understand. Your data will remain secure for the next year, and you're always welcome back.

Thank you for giving Dawarich a try. I hope to see you again soon!

Safe travels,
Evgenii from Dawarich
