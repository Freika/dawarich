# Tracks Feature Analysis

## Overview

The Tracks feature in Dawarich is a streamlined GPS route tracking system that automatically organizes location data into meaningful journeys. It transforms raw GPS points into structured track records that represent individual trips, walks, drives, or any other movement patterns using a simplified, unified architecture.

## Core Concept

A **Track** represents a continuous journey or route taken by a user. Unlike individual GPS points that are timestamped location coordinates, tracks provide higher-level information about complete journeys including start/end times, total distance, duration, speed statistics, and elevation changes.

## Key Components

### Track Data Structure

Each track contains:
- **Temporal Information**: Start and end timestamps marking the journey boundaries
- **Spatial Information**: Geographic path represented as a LineString containing all route coordinates
- **Distance Metrics**: Total distance traveled (stored in meters for consistency)
- **Speed Analytics**: Average speed throughout the journey (stored in km/h)
- **Duration Data**: Total time spent on the journey (in seconds)
- **Elevation Statistics**: Gain, loss, maximum, and minimum altitude measurements
- **User Association**: Links each track to its owner

### Simplified Track Generation Process

The system uses a unified, streamlined approach to create tracks:

1. **Unified Processing**: Single service handles both bulk and incremental processing
2. **Smart Segmentation**: Analyzes point sequences to identify natural break points between journeys
3. **Real-time Creation**: Immediately processes new GPS data as it arrives for responsive user experience
4. **Intelligent Batching**: Optimizes processing load while maintaining responsiveness

### Segmentation Intelligence

The system uses intelligent algorithms to determine where one track ends and another begins:

- **Time-based Segmentation**: Identifies gaps in GPS data that exceed configurable time thresholds (default: 60 minutes)
- **Distance-based Segmentation**: Detects sudden location jumps that indicate teleportation or data gaps (default: 500 meters)
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Users can adjust sensitivity through distance and time parameters
- **Minimum Requirements**: Ensures tracks have sufficient data points to be meaningful (minimum 2 points)

### Statistics Calculation

For each track, the system calculates comprehensive statistics:

- **Distance Calculation**: Uses geographical formulas to compute accurate distances between points
- **Speed Analysis**: Calculates average speed while handling stationary periods appropriately
- **Elevation Processing**: Analyzes altitude changes to determine climbs and descents
- **Duration Computation**: Accounts for actual movement time vs. total elapsed time

## Processing Modes

### Bulk Processing
- Processes all unassigned GPS points for a user at once
- Suitable for initial setup or historical data migration
- Optimized for performance with large datasets
- Triggered via scheduled job or manual execution

### Incremental Processing
- Handles new GPS points as they arrive in real-time
- Maintains system responsiveness during continuous tracking
- Uses smart batching to optimize performance
- Provides immediate user feedback

### Smart Real-time Processing
- **Immediate Processing**: Triggers instant track creation for obvious track boundaries (30+ minute gaps, 1+ km jumps)
- **Batched Processing**: Groups continuous tracking points for efficient processing
- **Automatic Optimization**: Reduces system load while maintaining user experience
