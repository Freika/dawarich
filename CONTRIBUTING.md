## How to contribute to Dawarich

Refer to [Repository Guidelines](AGENTS.md) for structure, tooling, and workflow expectations before submitting changes.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch against the `dev` branch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Dawarich will generally not be accepted. Same goes for chore changes, like updating dependencies, fixing typos, etc.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Dawarich in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/pHsBjpt5J8).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
