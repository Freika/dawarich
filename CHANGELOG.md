```ruby
# This will delete all tracks üëá
Track.delete_all

# This will remove all tracks relations from points üëá
Point.update_all(track_id: nil)

# This will create tracks for all users üëá
User.find_each do |user|

end
```

## Added

- In the User Settings -> Background Jobs, you can now disable visits suggestions, which is enabled by default. It's a background task that runs every day around midnight. Disabling it might be useful if you don't want to receive visits suggestions or if you're using the Dawarich iOS app, which has its own visits suggestions.
- Tracks are now being calculated and stored in the database instead of being calculated on the fly in the browser. This will make the map page load faster.

## Changed

- Don't check for new version in production.
- Area popup styles are now more consistent.
- Notification about Photon API load is now disabled.
- All distance values are now stored in the database in meters. Conversion to user's preferred unit is done on the fly.

# [0.29.1] - 2025-07-02

## Fixed

- Buttons on the imports page now looks better in both light and dark mode. #1481
- The PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED environment variable default value is now "false", in quotes.
- The RAILS_CACHE_DB, RAILS_JOB_QUEUE_DB and RAILS_WS_DB environment variables can be used to set the Redis database number for caching, background jobs and websocket connections respectively. Default values are now 0, 1 and 2 respectively. #1420

## Changed

- Skip DNS rebinding protection for the health check endpoint.
- Added health check to app.json.

# [0.29.0] - 2025-07-02

You can now move your user data between Dawarich instances. Simply go to your Account settings and click on the "Export my data" button under the password section. An export will be created and you will be able to download it on Exports page once it's ready.

To import your data on a new Dawarich instance, create a new user and upload the exported zip file. You can import your data also on the Account page, by clicking "Import my data" button under the password section.

The feature is experimental and not yet aimed to replace a proper backup solution. Please use at your own risk.

## Added

- In the User Settings, you can now export your user data as a zip file. It will contain the following:
  - All your points
  - All your places
  - All your visits
  - All your areas
  - All your imports with files
  - All your exports with files
  - All your trips
  - All your notifications
  - All your stats

- In the User Settings, you can now import your user data from a zip file. It will import all the data from the zip file, listed above. It will also start stats recalculation.
- Export file size is now displayed in the exports and imports lists.
- A button to download an import file is now displayed in the imports list. It may not work properly for imports created before the 0.25.4 release.
- Imports now have statuses.

## Changed

- Oj is now being used for JSON serialization.

## Fixed

- Email links now use the SMTP domain if set. #1469



# 0.28.1 - 2025-06-11

## Fixed

- Limit notifications in navbar to 10. Fresh one will replace the oldest one. #1184

## Changed

# 0.28.0 - 2025-06-09

‚ö†Ô∏è This release includes a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

_yet another, yay!_

Well, we're moving back to Sidekiq and Redis for background jobs and caching. Unfortunately, SolidQueue and SolidCache brought more problems than they solved. Please update your `docker-compose.yml` to use Redis and Sidekiq.

Before updating, you can remove `dawarich_development_queue` database from your postgres. All *.sqlite3 files in `dawarich_sqlite_data` volume can be removed as well.

## Removed

- Redis and Sidekiq.



# 0.27.1 - 2025-06-01

## Fixed

- Cache jobs are now being scheduled correctly after app start.
- `countries.geojson` now have fixed alpha codes for France and Norway



# 0.27.0 - 2025-06-01

‚ö†Ô∏è This release includes a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Starting 0.27.0, Dawarich is using SolidQueue and SolidCache to run background jobs and cache data. Before updating, make sure your Sidekiq queues (https://your_dawarich_app/sidekiq) are empty.

Moving to SolidQueue and SolidCache will require creating new SQLite databases, which will be created automatically when you start the app. They will be stored in the `dawarich_db_data` volume.

Background jobs interface is now available at `/jobs` page.

Please, update your `docker-compose.yml` and add the following:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    volumes:
      - dawarich_public:/var/app/public
      - dawarich_watched:/var/app/tmp/imports/watched
      - dawarich_storage:/var/app/storage
+     - dawarich_db_data:/dawarich_db_data
...
    environment:
      ...
      DATABASE_NAME: dawarich_development
      # SQLite database paths for secondary databases
+     QUEUE_DATABASE_PATH: /dawarich_db_data/dawarich_development_queue.sqlite3
+     CACHE_DATABASE_PATH: /dawarich_db_data/dawarich_development_cache.sqlite3
+     CABLE_DATABASE_PATH: /dawarich_db_data/dawarich_development_cable.sqlite3
```


## Fixed

- Enable caching in development for the docker image to improve performance.

## Changed

- SolidCache is now being used for caching instead of Redis.
- SolidQueue is now being used for background jobs instead of Sidekiq.
- SolidCable is now being used as ActionCable adapter.
- Background jobs are now being run as Puma plugin instead of separate Docker container.
- The `rc` docker image is now being built for amd64 architecture only to speed up the build process.
- Deleting an import with many points now works significantly faster.



# 0.26.7 - 2025-05-29

- Route opacity is now being displayed as percentage in the map settings. #462 #1224
- Exported GeoJSON file now contains coordinates as floats instead of strings, as per RFC 7946. #762
- Fog of war now can be set to 200 meter per point. #630
# 0.26.5 - 2025-05-20

## Fixed

- Wget is back to fix healthchecks. #1241 #1231
- Dockerfile.prod is now using slim image. #1245

# 0.26.3 - 2025-05-18

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where default distance unit was not being set for users. #1206


# 0.26.2 - 2025-05-18

## Fixed

- Seeds are now working properly. #1207
- Fixed a bug where France flag was not being displayed correctly. #1204
- Fix blank map page caused by empty default distance unit. Default distance unit is now kilometers and can be changed in Settings -> Maps. #1206


# 0.26.1 - 2025-05-18

## Geodata on demand

This release introduces a new environment variable `STORE_GEODATA` with default value `true` to control whether to store geodata in the database or not. Currently, geodata is being used when:

- Fetching places geodata
- Fetching countries for a trip
- Suggesting place name for a visit

Opting out of storing geodata will make each feature that uses geodata to make a direct request to the geocoding service to calculate required data instead of using existing geodata from the database. Setting `STORE_GEODATA` to `false` can also use you some database space.

If you decide to opt out, you can safely delete your existing geodata from the database:

1. Get into the [console](https://dawarich.app/docs/FAQ/#how-to-enter-dawarich-console)
2. Run the following commands:

```ruby
Point.update_all(geodata: {}) # to remove existing geodata

ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("VACUUM FULL") # to free up some space
```

Note, that this will take some time to complete, depending on the number of points you have. This is not a required step.

If you're running your own Photon instance, you can safely set `STORE_GEODATA` to `false`, otherwise it'd be better to keep it enabled, because that way Dawarich will be using existing geodata for its calculations.

Also, after updating to this version, Dawarich will start a huge background job to calculate countries for all your points. Just let it work.

## Added

- Map page now has a button to go to the previous and next day. #296 #631 #904
- Clicking on number of countries and cities in stats cards now opens a modal with a list of countries and cities visited in that year.

## Changed

- Reverse geocoding is now working as on-demand job instead of storing the result in the database. #619
- Stats cards now show the last update time. #733
- Visit card now shows buttons to confirm or decline a visit only if it's not confirmed or declined yet.
- Distance unit is now being stored in the user settings. You can choose between kilometers and miles, default is kilometers. The setting is accessible in the user settings -> Maps -> Distance Unit. You might want to recalculate your stats after changing the unit. #1126
- Fog of war is now being displayed as lines instead of dots. Thanks to @MeijiRestored!

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug with an attempt to write points with same lonlat and timestamp from iOS app. #1170
- Importing GeoJSON files now saves velocity if it was stored in either `velocity` or `speed` property.
- `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` should work properly now. #1083 #1161
- PostGIS extension is now being enabled only if it's not already enabled. #1186
- Fixed a bug where visits were returning into Suggested state after being confirmed or declined. #848
- If no points are found for a month during stats calculation, stats are now being deleted instead of being left empty. #1066 #406

## Removed

- Removed `DISTANCE_UNIT` constant. It can be safely removed from your environment variables in docker-compose.yml.


# 0.26.0 - 2025-05-08

‚ö†Ô∏è This release includes a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Starting this version, Dawarich requires PostgreSQL 17 with PostGIS 3.5. If you haven't updated your database image yet, please consider doing so as suggested in the [docs on the website](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/update-postgresql/). Simply replacing the image in the `docker-compose.yml` unfortunately doesn't work, as PostgreSQL 17 is not backwards compatible with 14 (which was used in previous versions).

If you have encountered problems with moving to a PostGIS image while still on Postgres 14, I collected a selection of compatible docker images for different CPU architectures, which you can also find in the [docs](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/moving-to-postgis/). New users will be automatically provisioned with PostgreSQL 17 with PostGIS 3.5 with default `docker-compose.yml` file.

**You still may use PostgreSQL 14, but no support will be provided for it starting this version. It's strongly recommended to update to PostgreSQL 17.**

## Changed

- Dawarich now uses PostgreSQL 17 with PostGIS 3.5 by default.


# 0.25.10 - 2025-05-08

## Added

- Vector maps are supported in non-self-hosted mode.
- Credentials for Sidekiq UI are now being set via environment variables: `SIDEKIQ_USERNAME` and `SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD`. Default credentials are `sidekiq` and `password`. If you don't set them, in self-hosted mode, Sidekiq UI will not be protected by basic auth.
- New import page now shows progress of the upload.

## Changed

- Datetime is now being displayed with seconds in the Points page. #1088
- Imported files are now being uploaded via direct uploads.
- `/api/v1/points` endpoint now creates accepted points synchronously.

## Removed

- Sample points are no longer being imported automatically for new users.

# 0.25.9 - 2025-04-29

## Fixed

- `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` task now works properly.

# 0.25.8 - 2025-04-24

## Fixed

- Database was not being created if it didn't exist. #1076

## Removed

- `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable is no longer being set. You can safely remove it from your environment variables.

# 0.25.7 - 2025-04-24

## Fixed

- Map loading error. #1094

# 0.25.6 - 2025-04-23

## Added

- In the map settings (top left corner of the map), you can now select colors for your colored routes. #682

## Changed

- Import edit page now allows to edit import name.
- Importing data now does not create a notification for the user.
- Updating stats now does not create a notification for the user.

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where an import was failing due to partial file download. #1069 #1073 #1024 #1051

# 0.25.5 - 2025-04-18

This release introduces a new way to send transactional emails using SMTP. Example may include password reset, email confirmation, etc.

To enable SMTP mailing, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `SMTP_SERVER` - SMTP server address.
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port.
- `SMTP_DOMAIN` - SMTP server domain.
- `SMTP_USERNAME` - SMTP server username.
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP server password.
- `SMTP_FROM` - Email address to send emails from.

This is optional feature and is not required for the app to work.

## Removed

- Optional telemetry was removed from the app. The `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` env var can be safely removed from docker compose.

## Changed

- `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` task now also tries to extract latitude and longitude from `raw_data` column before using `longitude` and `latitude` columns to fill `lonlat` column.
- Docker entrypoints are now using `DATABASE_NAME` environment variable to check if Postgres is existing/available.
- Sidekiq web UI is now protected by basic auth. Use `SIDEKIQ_USERNAME` and `SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD` environment variables to set the credentials.

## Added

- You can now provide SMTP settings in ENV vars to send emails.
- You can now edit imports. #1044 #623

## Fixed

- Importing data from Immich now works correctly. #1019


# 0.25.4 - 2025-04-02

‚ö†Ô∏è This release includes a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Make sure to add `dawarich_storage` volume and `SELF_HOSTED: "true"` to your `docker-compose.yml` file. Example:

```diff
...

  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    volumes:
      - dawarich_public:/var/app/public
      - dawarich_watched:/var/app/tmp/imports/watched
+     - dawarich_storage:/var/app/storage
...
    environment:
+     SELF_HOSTED: "true"

...

  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
      - dawarich_public:/var/app/public
      - dawarich_watched:/var/app/tmp/imports/watched
+     - dawarich_storage:/var/app/storage
...
    environment:
+     SELF_HOSTED: "true"


volumes:
  dawarich_db_data:
  dawarich_shared:
  dawarich_public:
  dawarich_watched:
+ dawarich_storage:
```


In this release we're changing the way import files are being stored. Previously, they were being stored in the `raw_data` column of the `imports` table. Now, they are being attached to the import record. All new imports will be using the new storage, to migrate existing imports, you can use the `bundle exec rake imports:migrate_to_new_storage` task. Run it in the container shell.

This is an optional task, that will not affect your points or other data.
Big imports might take a while to migrate, so be patient.

Also, you can now migrate existing exports to the new storage using the `bundle exec rake exports:migrate_to_new_storage` task (in the container shell) or just delete them.

If your hardware doesn't have enough memory to migrate the imports, you can delete your imports and re-import them.

## Added

- Sentry is now can be used for error tracking.
- Subscription management is now available in non self-hosted mode.

## Changed

- Import files are now being attached to the import record instead of being stored in the `raw_data` database column.
- Import files can now be stored in S3-compatible storage.
- Export files are now being attached to the export record instead of being stored in the file system.
- Export files can now be stored in S3-compatible storage.
- Users can now import Google's Records.json file via the UI instead of using the CLI.
- Optional telemetry sending is now disabled and will be removed in the future.

## Fixed

- Moving points on the map now works correctly. #957
- `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` task now also reindexes the points table.
- Fixed filling `lonlat` column for old places after reverse geocoding.
- Deleting an import now correctly recalculates stats.
- Datetime across the app is now being displayed in human readable format, i.e 26 Dec 2024, 13:49. Hover over the datetime to see the ISO 8601 timestamp.


# 0.25.3 - 2025-03-22

## Fixed

- Fixed missing `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` task.

# 0.25.2 - 2025-03-21

## Fixed

- Migration to add unique index to points now contains code to remove duplicates from the database.
- Issue with ESRI maps not being displayed correctly. #956

## Added

- `bundle exec rake data_cleanup:remove_duplicate_points` task added to remove duplicate points from the database and export them to a CSV file.
- `bundle exec rake points:migrate_to_lonlat` task added for convenient manual migration of points to the new `lonlat` column.
- `bundle exec rake users:activate` task added to activate all users.

## Changed

- Merged visits now use the combined name of the merged visits.

# 0.25.1 - 2025-03-17

## Fixed

- Coordinates on the Points page are now being displayed correctly.

# 0.25.0 - 2025-03-09

This release is focused on improving the visits experience.

Since previous implementation of visits was not working as expected, this release introduces a new approach. It is recommended to remove all _non-confirmed_ visits before or after updating to this version.

There is a known issue when data migrations are not being run automatically on some systems. If you're experiencing issues when opening map page, trips page or when trying to see visits, try executing the following command in the [Console](https://dawarich.app/docs/FAQ/#how-to-enter-dawarich-console):

```ruby
User.includes(:tracked_points, visits: :places).find_each do |user|
  places_to_update = user.places.where(lonlat: nil)

  # For each place, set the lonlat value based on longitude and latitude
  places_to_update.find_each do |place|
    next if place.longitude.nil? || place.latitude.nil?

    # Set the lonlat to a PostGIS point with the proper SRID
    # rubocop:disable Rails/SkipsModelValidations
    place.update_column(:lonlat, "SRID=4326;POINT(#{place.longitude} #{place.latitude})")
    # rubocop:enable Rails/SkipsModelValidations
  end

  user.tracked_points.update_all('lonlat = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326)')
end
```

With any errors, don't hesitate to ask for help in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pHsBjpt5J8).

## Added

- A new button to open the visits drawer.
- User can now confirm or decline visits directly from the visits drawer.
- Visits are now being shown on the map: orange circles for suggested visits and slightly bigger blue circles for confirmed visits.
- User can click on a visit circle to rename it and select a place for it.
- User can click on a visit card in the drawer panel to move to it on the map.
- User can select click on the "Select area" button in the top right corner of the map to select an area on the map. Once area is selected, visits for all times in that area will be shown on the map, regardless of whether they are in the selected time range or not.
- User can now select two or more visits in the visits drawer and merge them into a single visit. This operation is not reversible.
- User can now select two or more visits in the visits drawer and confirm or decline them at once. This operation is not reversible.
- Status field to the User model. Inactive users are now being restricted from accessing some of the functionality, which is mostly about writing data to the database. Reading is remaining unrestricted.
- After user is created, a sample import is being created for them to demonstrate how to use the app.


## Changed

- Links to Points, Visits & Places, Imports and Exports were moved under "My data" section in the navbar.
- Restrict access to Sidekiq in non self-hosted mode.
- Restrict access to background jobs in non self-hosted mode.
- Restrict access to users management in non self-hosted mode.
- Restrict access to API for inactive users.
- All users in self-hosted mode are active by default.
- Points are now using `lonlat` column for storing longitude and latitude.
- Semantic history points are now being imported much faster.
- GPX files are now being imported much faster.
- Trips, places and points are now using PostGIS' database attributes for storing longitude and latitude.
- Distance calculation are now using Postgis functions and expected to be more accurate.

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where non-admin users could not import Immich and Photoprism geolocation data.
- Fixed a bug where upon point deletion it was not being removed from the map, while it was actually deleted from the database. #883
- Fixed a bug where upon import deletion stats were not being recalculated. #824

# 0.24.1 - 2025-02-13

## Custom map tiles

In the user settings, you can now set a custom tile URL for the map. This is useful if you want to use a custom map tile provider or if you want to use a map tile provider that is not listed in the dropdown.

To set a custom tile URL, go to the user settings and set the `Maps` section to your liking. Be mindful that currently, only raster tiles are supported. The URL should be a valid tile URL, like `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. You, as the user, are responsible for any extra costs that may occur due to using a custom tile URL.

### Added

- Safe settings for user with default values.
- Nominatim API is now supported as a reverse geocoding provider.
- In the user settings, you can now set a custom tile URL for the map. #429 #715
- In the user map settings, you can now see a chart of map tiles usage.
- If you have Prometheus exporter enabled, you can now see a `ruby_dawarich_map_tiles` metric in Prometheus, which shows the total number of map tiles loaded. Example:

```
# HELP ruby_dawarich_map_tiles_usage
# TYPE ruby_dawarich_map_tiles_usage counter
ruby_dawarich_map_tiles_usage 99
```

### Fixed

- Speed on the Points page is now being displayed in kilometers per hour. #700
- Fog of war displacement #774

### Reverted

- #748

# 0.24.0 - 2025-02-10

## Points speed units

Dawarich expects speed to be sent in meters per second. It's already known that OwnTracks and GPSLogger (in some configurations) are sending speed in kilometers per hour.

In GPSLogger it's easily fixable: if you previously had `"vel": "%SPD_KMH"`, change it to `"vel": "%SPD"`, like it's described in the [docs](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location#gps-logger).

In OwnTracks it's a bit more complicated. You can't change the speed unit in the settings, so Dawarich will expect speed in kilometers per hour and will convert it to meters per second. Nothing is needed to be done from your side.

Now, we need to fix existing points with speed in kilometers per hour. The following guide assumes that you have been tracking your location exclusively with speed in kilometers per hour. If you have been using both speed units (say, were tracking with OwnTracks in kilometers per hour and with GPSLogger in meters per second), you need to decide what to do with points that have speed in kilometers per hour, as there is no easy way to distinguish them from points with speed in meters per second.

To convert speed in kilometers per hour to meters per second in your points, follow these steps:

1. Enter [Dawarich console](https://dawarich.app/docs/FAQ#how-to-enter-dawarich-console)
2. Run `points = Point.where(import_id: nil).where.not(velocity: [nil, "0"]).where("velocity NOT LIKE '%.%'")`. This will return all tracked (not imported) points.
3. Run
```ruby
points.update_all("velocity = CAST(ROUND(CAST((CAST(velocity AS FLOAT) * 1000 / 3600) AS NUMERIC), 1) AS TEXT)")

```

This will convert speed in kilometers per hour to meters per second and round it to 1 decimal place.

If you have been using both speed units, but you know the dates where you were tracking with speed in kilometers per hour, on the second step of the instruction above, you can add `where("timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?", Date.parse("2025-01-01").beginning_of_day.to_i, Date.parse("2025-01-31").end_of_day.to_i)` to the query to convert speed in kilometers per hour to meters per second only for a specific period of time. Resulting query will look like this:

```ruby
start_at = DateTime.new(2025, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0).in_time_zone(Time.current.time_zone).to_i
end_at = DateTime.new(2025, 1, 31, 23, 59, 59).in_time_zone(Time.current.time_zone).to_i
points = Point.where(import_id: nil).where.not(velocity: [nil, "0"]).where("timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?", start_at, end_at).where("velocity NOT LIKE '%.%'")
```

This will select points tracked between January 1st and January 31st 2025. Then just use step 3 to convert speed in kilometers per hour to meters per second.

### Changed

- Speed for points, that are sent to Dawarich via `POST /api/v1/owntracks/points` endpoint, will now be converted to meters per second, if `topic` param is sent. The official GPSLogger instructions are assuming user won't be sending `topic` param, so this shouldn't affect you if you're using GPSLogger.

### Fixed

- After deleting one point from the map, other points can now be deleted as well. #723 #678
- Fixed a bug where export file was not being deleted from the server after it was deleted. #808
- After an area was drawn on the map, a popup is now being shown to allow user to provide a name and save the area. #740
- Docker entrypoints now use database name to fix problem with custom database names.
- Garmin GPX files with empty tracks are now being imported correctly. #827

### Added

- `X-Dawarich-Version` header to the `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint response.

# 0.23.6 - 2025-02-06

### Added

- Enabled Postgis extension for PostgreSQL.
- Trips are now store their paths in the database independently of the points.
- Trips are now being rendered on the map using their precalculated paths instead of list of coordinates.

### Changed

- Ruby version was updated to 3.4.1.
- Requesting photos on the Map page now uses the start and end dates from the URL params. #589

# 0.23.5 - 2025-01-22

### Added

- A test for building rc Docker image.

### Fixed

- Fix authentication to `GET /api/v1/countries/visited_cities` with header `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` instead of `api_key` query param. #679
- Fix a bug where a gpx file with empty tracks was not being imported. #646
- Fix a bug where rc version was being checked as a stable release. #711

# 0.23.3 - 2025-01-21

### Changed

- Synology-related files are now up to date. #684

### Fixed

- Drastically improved performance for Google's Records.json import. It will now take less than 5 minutes to import 500,000 points, which previously took a few hours.

### Fixed

- Add index only if it doesn't exist.

# 0.23.1 - 2025-01-21

### Fixed

- Renamed unique index on points to `unique_points_lat_long_timestamp_user_id_index` to fix naming conflict with `unique_points_index`.

# 0.23.0 - 2025-01-20

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

This release includes a data migration to remove duplicated points from the database. It will not remove anything except for duplcates from the `points` table, but please make sure to create a [backup](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/backup-and-restore) before updating to this version.

### Added

- `POST /api/v1/points/create` endpoint added.
- An index to guarantee uniqueness of points across `latitude`, `longitude`, `timestamp` and `user_id` values. This is introduced to make sure no duplicates will be created in the database in addition to previously existing validations.
- `GET /api/v1/users/me` endpoint added to get current user.

# 0.22.4 - 2025-01-20

### Added

- You can now drag-n-drop a point on the map to update its position. Enable the "Points" layer on the map to see the points.
- `PATCH /api/v1/points/:id` endpoint added to update a point. It only accepts `latitude` and `longitude` params. #51 #503

### Changed

- Run seeds even in prod env so Unraid users could have default user.
- Precompile assets in production env using dummy secret key base.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where route wasn't highlighted when it was hovered or clicked.

# 0.22.3 - 2025-01-14

### Changed

- The Map now uses a canvas to draw polylines, points and fog of war. This should improve performance in browser with a lot of points and polylines.

# 0.22.2 - 2025-01-13

‚ú® The Fancy Routes release ‚ú®

### Added

- In the Map Settings (coggle in the top left corner of the map), you can now enable/disable the Fancy Routes feature. Simply said, it will color your routes based on the speed of each segment.
- Hovering over a polyline now shows the speed of the segment. Move cursor over a polyline to see the speed of different segments.
- Distance and points number in the custom control to the map.

### Changed

- The name of the "Polylines" feature is now "Routes".

‚ö†Ô∏è Important note on the Prometheus monitoring ‚ö†Ô∏è

In the previous release, `bin/dev` command in the default `docker-compose.yml` file was replaced with `bin/rails server -p 3000 -b ::`, but this way Dawarich won't be able to start Prometheus Exporter. If you want to use Prometheus monitoring, you need to use `bin/dev` command instead.

Example:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
...
-    command: ['bin/rails', 'server', '-p', '3000', '-b', '::']
+    command: ['bin/dev']
```

# 0.22.1 - 2025-01-09

### Removed

- Gems caching volume from the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To update existing `docker-compose.yml` to new changes, refer to the following:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
...
    volumes:
-      - dawarich_gem_cache_app:/usr/local/bundle/gems
...
  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
...
    volumes:
-      - dawarich_gem_cache_app:/usr/local/bundle/gems
...

volumes:
  dawarich_db_data:
- dawarich_gem_cache_app:
- dawarich_gem_cache_sidekiq:
  dawarich_shared:
  dawarich_public:
  dawarich_watched:
```

### Changed

- `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint now returns a `X-Dawarich-Response: Hey, Im alive and authenticated!` header if user is authenticated.

# 0.22.0 - 2025-01-09

‚ö†Ô∏è This release introduces a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Please read this release notes carefully before upgrading.

Docker-related files were moved to the `docker` directory and some of them were renamed. Before upgrading, study carefully changes in the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file and update your docker-compose file accordingly, so it uses the new files and commands. Copying `docker/docker-compose.yml` blindly may lead to errors.

No volumes were removed or renamed, so with a proper docker-compose file, you should be able to upgrade without any issues.

To update existing `docker-compose.yml` to new changes, refer to the following:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
...
-    entrypoint: dev-entrypoint.sh
-    command: ['bin/dev']
+    entrypoint: web-entrypoint.sh
+    command: ['bin/rails', 'server', '-p', '3000', '-b', '::']
...
  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
...
-    entrypoint: dev-entrypoint.sh
-    command: ['bin/dev']
+    entrypoint: sidekiq-entrypoint.sh
+    command: ['bundle', 'exec', 'sidekiq']
```

Although `docker-compose.production.yml` was added, it's not being used by default. It's just an example of how to configure Dawarich for production. The default `docker-compose.yml` file is still recommended for running the app.

### Changed

- All docker-related files were moved to the `docker` directory.
- Default memory limit for `dawarich_app` and `dawarich_sidekiq` services was increased to 4GB.
- `dawarich_app` and `dawarich_sidekiq` services now use separate entrypoint scripts.
- Gems (dependency libraries) are now being shipped as part of the Dawarich Docker image.

### Fixed

- Visit suggesting job does nothing if user has no tracked points.
- `BulkStatsCalculationJob` now being called without arguments in the data migration.

### Added

- A proper production Dockerfile, docker-compose and env files.

# 0.21.6 - 2025-01-07

### Changed

- Disabled visit suggesting job after import.
- Improved performance of the `User#years_tracked` method.

### Fixed

- Inconsistent password for the `dawarich_db` service in `docker-compose_mounted_volumes.yml`. #605
- Points are now being rendered with higher z-index than polylines. #577
- Run cache cleaning and preheating jobs only on server start. #594

# 0.21.5 - 2025-01-07

You may now use Geoapify API for reverse geocoding. To obtain an API key, sign up at https://myprojects.geoapify.com/ and create a new project. Make sure you have read and understood the [pricing policy](https://www.geoapify.com/pricing) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.geoapify.com/terms-and-conditions/).

### Added

- Geoapify API support for reverse geocoding. Provide `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` env var to use it.

### Removed

- Photon ENV vars from the `.env.development` and docker-compose.yml files.
- `APPLICATION_HOST` env var.
- `REVERSE_GEOCODING_ENABLED` env var.

# 0.21.4 - 2025-01-05

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Photon API for patreon supporters was not being used for reverse geocoding.

# 0.21.3 - 2025-01-04

### Added

- A notification about Photon API being under heavy load.

### Removed

- The notification about telemetry being enabled.

### Reverted

- ~~Imported points will now be reverse geocoded only after import is finished.~~

# 0.21.2 - 2024-12-25

### Added

- Logging for Immich responses.
- Watcher now supports all data formats that can be imported via web interface.

### Changed

- Imported points will now be reverse geocoded only after import is finished.

### Fixed

- Markers on the map are now being rendered with higher z-index than polylines. #577

# 0.21.1 - 2024-12-24

### Added

- Cache cleaning and preheating upon application start.
- `PHOTON_API_KEY` env var to set Photon API key. It's an optional env var, but it's required if you want to use Photon API as a Patreon supporter.
- 'X-Dawarich-Response' header to the `GET /api/v1/health` endpoint. It's set to 'Hey, I\'m alive!' to make it easier to check if the API is working.

### Changed

- Custom config for PostgreSQL is now optional in `docker-compose.yml`.

# 0.21.0 - 2024-12-20

‚ö†Ô∏è This release introduces a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `dawarich_db` service now uses a custom `postgresql.conf` file.

As @tabacha pointed out in #549, the default `shm_size` for the `dawarich_db` service is too small and it may lead to database performance issues. This release introduces a `shm_size` parameter to the `dawarich_db` service to increase the size of the shared memory for PostgreSQL. This should help database with peforming vacuum and other operations. Also, it introduces a custom `postgresql.conf` file to the `dawarich_db` service.

To mount a custom `postgresql.conf` file, you need to create a `postgresql.conf` file in the `dawarich_db` service directory and add the following line to it:

```diff
  dawarich_db:
    image: postgis/postgis:14-3.5-alpine
    shm_size: 1G
    container_name: dawarich_db
    volumes:
      - dawarich_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - dawarich_shared:/var/shared
+     - ./postgresql.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgres.conf # Provide path to custom config
  ...
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres -d dawarich_development" ]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
      timeout: 10s
+   command: postgres -c config_file=/etc/postgresql/postgres.conf # Use custom config
```

To ensure your database is using custom config, you can connect to the container (`docker exec -it dawarich_db psql -U postgres`) and run `SHOW config_file;` command. It should return the following path: `/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf`.

An example of a custom `postgresql.conf` file is provided in the `postgresql.conf.example` file.

### Added

- A button on a year stats card to update stats for the whole year. #466
- A button on a month stats card to update stats for a specific month. #466
- A confirmation alert on the Notifications page before deleting all notifications.
- A `shm_size` parameter to the `dawarich_db` service to increase the size of the shared memory for PostgreSQL. This should help database with peforming vacuum and other operations.

```diff
  ...
  dawarich_db:
    image: postgis/postgis:14-3.5-alpine
+   shm_size: 1G
  ...
```

- In addition to `api_key` parameter, `Authorization` header is now being used to authenticate API requests. #543

Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Changed

- The map borders were expanded to make it easier to scroll around the map for New Zealanders.
- The `dawarich_db` service now uses a custom `postgresql.conf` file.
- The popup over polylines now shows dates in the user's format, based on their browser settings.

# 0.20.2 - 2024-12-17

### Added

- A point id is now being shown in the point popup.

### Fixed

- North Macedonia is now being shown on the scratch map. #537

### Changed

- The app process is now bound to :: instead of 0.0.0.0 to provide compatibility with IPV6.
- The app was updated to use Rails 8.0.1.

# 0.20.1 - 2024-12-16

### Fixed

- Setting `reverse_geocoded_at` for points that don't have geodata is now being performed in background job, in batches of 10,000 points to prevent memory exhaustion and long-running data migration.

# 0.20.0 - 2024-12-16

### Added

- `GET /api/v1/points/tracked_months` endpoint added to get list of tracked years and months.
- `GET /api/v1/countries/visited_cities` endpoint added to get list of visited cities.
- A link to the docs leading to a help chart for k8s. #550
- A button to delete all notifications. #548
- A support for `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL` env var to change log level. More on that here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#log-levels. The available log levels are: `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error`, `:fatal`, and `:unknown`, corresponding to the log level numbers from 0 up to 5, respectively. The default log level is `:debug`. #540
- A devcontainer to improve developers experience. #546

### Fixed

- A point popup is no longer closes when hovering over a polyline. #536
- When polylines layer is disabled and user deletes a point from its popup, polylines layer is no longer being enabled right away. #552
- Paths to gems within the sidekiq and app containers. #499

### Changed

- Months and years navigation is moved to a map panel on the right side of the map.
- List of visited cities is now being shown in a map panel on the right side of the map.

# 0.19.7 - 2024-12-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where upon deleting a point on the map, the confirmation dialog was shown multiple times and the point was not being deleted from the map until the page was reloaded. #435

### Changed

- With the "Points" layer enabled on the map, points with negative speed are now being shown in orange color. Since Overland reports negative speed for points that might be faulty, this should help you to identify them.
- On the Points page, speed of the points with negative speed is now being shown in red color.

# 0.19.6 - 2024-12-11

‚ö†Ô∏è This release introduces a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `dawarich_shared` volume now being mounted to `/data` instead of `/var/shared` within the container. It fixes Redis data being lost on container restart.

To change this, you need to update the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```diff
  dawarich_redis:
    image: redis:7.0-alpine
    container_name: dawarich_redis
    command: redis-server
    volumes:
+     - dawarich_shared:/data
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
```

Telemetry is now disabled by default. To enable it, you need to set `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` env var to `true`. For those who have telemetry enabled using `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` env var set to `false`, telemetry is now disabled by default.

### Fixed

- Flash messages are now being removed after 5 seconds.
- Fixed broken migration that was preventing the app from starting.
- Visits page is now loading a lot faster than before.
- Redis data should now be preserved on container restart.
- Fixed a bug where export files could have double extension, e.g. `file.gpx.gpx`.

### Changed

- Places page is now accessible from the Visits & Places tab on the navbar.
- Exporting process is now being logged.
- `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` env var is now used instead of `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to enable/disable telemetry.

# 0.19.5 - 2024-12-10

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the map and visits pages were throwing an error due to incorrect approach to distance calculation.

# 0.19.4 - 2024-12-10

‚ö†Ô∏è This release introduces a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `GET /api/v1/trips/:id/photos` endpoint now returns a different structure of the response:

```diff
{
  id: 1,
  latitude: 10,
  longitude: 10,
  localDateTime: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  originalFileName: "photo.jpg",
  city: "Berlin",
  state: "Berlin",
  country: "Germany",
  type: "image",
+ orientation: "portrait",
  source: "photoprism"
}
```

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the Photoprism photos were not being shown on the trip page.
- Fixed a bug where the Immich photos were not being shown on the trip page.
- Fixed a bug where the route popup was showing distance in kilometers instead of miles. #490

### Added

- A link to the Photoprism photos on the trip page if there are any.
- A `orientation` field in the Api::PhotoSerializer, hence the `GET /api/v1/photos` endpoint now includes the orientation of the photo. Valid values are `portrait` and `landscape`.
- Examples for the `type`, `orientation` and `source` fields in the `GET /api/v1/photos` endpoint in the Swagger UI.
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` env var to disable telemetry. More on telemetry: https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/telemetry
- `reverse_geocoded_at` column added to the `points` table.

### Changed

- On the Stats page, the "Reverse geocoding" section is now showing the number of points that were reverse geocoded based on `reverse_geocoded_at` column, value of which is based on the time when the point was reverse geocoded. If no geodata for the point is available, `reverse_geocoded_at` will be set anyway. Number of points that were reverse geocoded but no geodata is available for them is shown below the "Reverse geocoded" number.


# 0.19.3 - 2024-12-06

### Changed

- Refactored stats calculation to calculate only necessary stats, instead of calculating all stats
- Stats are now being calculated every 1 hour instead of 6 hours
- List of years on the Map page is now being calculated based on user's points instead of stats. It's also being cached for 1 day due to the fact that it's usually a heavy operation based on the number of points.
- Reverse-geocoding points is now being performed in batches of 1,000 points to prevent memory exhaustion.

### Added

- In-app notification about telemetry being enabled.

# 0.19.2 - 2024-12-04

## The Telemetry release

Dawarich now can collect usage metrics and send them to InfluxDB. Before this release, the only metrics that could be somehow tracked by developers (only @Freika, as of now) were the number of stars on GitHub and the overall number of docker images being pulled, across all versions of Dawarich, non-splittable by version. New in-app telemetry will allow us to track more granular metrics, allowing me to make decisions based on facts, not just guesses.

I'm aware about the privacy concerns, so I want to be very transparent about what data is being sent and how it's used.

Data being sent:

- Number of DAU (Daily Active Users)
- App version
- Instance ID (unique identifier of the Dawarich instance built by hashing the api key of the first user in the database)

The data is being sent to a InfluxDB instance hosted by me and won't be shared with anyone.

Basically this set of metrics allows me to see how many people are using Dawarich and what versions they are using. No other data is being sent, nor it gives me any knowledge about individual users or their data or activity.

The telemetry is enabled by default, but it **can be disabled** by setting `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` env var to `true`. The dataset might change in the future, but any changes will be documented here in the changelog and in every release as well as on the [telemetry page](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/telemetry) of the website docs.

### Added

- Telemetry feature. It's now collecting usage metrics and sending them to InfluxDB.

# 0.19.1 - 2024-12-04

### Fixed

- Sidekiq is now being correctly exported to Prometheus with `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED=true` env var in `dawarich_sidekiq` service.

# 0.19.0 - 2024-12-04

## The Photoprism integration release

‚ö†Ô∏è This release introduces a breaking change. ‚ö†Ô∏è
The `GET /api/v1/photos` endpoint now returns following structure of the response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "latitude": 11.22,
    "longitude": 12.33,
    "localDateTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "originalFileName": "photo.jpg",
    "city": "Berlin",
    "state": "Berlin",
    "country": "Germany",
    "type": "image", // "image" or "video"
    "source": "photoprism" // "photoprism" or "immich"
  }
]
```

### Added

- Photos from Photoprism are now can be shown on the map. To enable this feature, you need to provide your Photoprism instance URL and API key in the Settings page. Then you need to enable "Photos" layer on the map (top right corner).
- Geodata is now can be imported from Photoprism to Dawarich. The "Import Photoprism data" button on the Imports page will start the import process.

### Fixed

- z-index on maps so they won't overlay notifications dropdown
- Redis connectivity where it's not required

# 0.18.2 - 2024-11-29

### Added

- Demo account. You can now login with `demo@dawarich.app` / `password` to see how Dawarich works. This replaces previous default credentials.

### Changed

- The login page now shows demo account credentials if `DEMO_ENV` env var is set to `true`.

# 0.18.1 - 2024-11-29

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the trips interface was breaking when Immich integration is not configured.

### Added

- Flash messages are now being shown on the map when Immich integration is not configured.

# 0.18.0 - 2024-11-28

## The Trips release

You can now create, edit and delete trips. To create a trip, click on the "New Trip" button on the Trips page. Provide a name, date and time for start and end of the trip. You can add your own notes to the trip as well.

If you have points tracked during provided timeframe, they will be automatically added to the trip and will be shown on the trip map.

Also, if you have Immich integrated, you will see photos from the trip on the trip page, along with a link to look at them on Immich.

### Added

- The Trips feature. Read above for more details.

### Changed

- Maps are now not so rough on the edges.

# 0.17.2 - 2024-11-27

### Fixed

- Retrieving photos from Immich now using `takenAfter` and `takenBefore` instead of `createdAfter` and `createdBefore`. With `createdAfter` and `createdBefore` Immich was returning no items some years.

# 0.17.1 - 2024-11-27

### Fixed

- Retrieving photos from Immich now correctly handles cases when Immich returns no items. It also logs the response from Immich for debugging purposes.

# 0.17.0 - 2024-11-26

## The Immich Photos release

With this release, Dawarich can now show photos from your Immich instance on the map.

To enable this feature, you need to provide your Immich instance URL and API key in the Settings page. Then you need to enable "Photos" layer on the map (top right corner).

An important note to add here is that photos are heavy and hence generate a lot of traffic. The response from Immich for specific dates is being cached in Redis for 1 day, and that may lead to Redis taking a lot more space than previously. But since the cache is being expired after 24 hours, you'll get your space back pretty soon.

The other thing worth mentioning is how Dawarich gets data from Immich. It goes like this:

1. When you click on the "Photos" layer, Dawarich will make a request to `GET /api/v1/photos` endpoint to get photos for the selected timeframe.
2. This endpoint will make a request to `POST /search/metadata` endpoint of your Immich instance to get photos for the selected timeframe.
3. The response from Immich is being cached in Redis for 1 day.
4. Dawarich's frontend will make a request to `GET /api/v1/photos/:id/thumbnail.jpg` endpoint to get photo thumbnail from Immich. The number of requests to this endpoint will depend on how many photos you have in the selected timeframe.
5. For each photo, Dawarich's frontend will make a request to `GET /api/v1/photos/:id/thumbnail.jpg` endpoint to get photo thumbnail from Immich. This thumbnail request is also cached in Redis for 1 day.


### Added

- If you have provided your Immich instance URL and API key, the map will now show photos from your Immich instance when Photos layer is enabled.
- `GET /api/v1/photos` endpoint added to get photos from Immich.
- `GET /api/v1/photos/:id/thumbnail.jpg` endpoint added to get photo thumbnail from Immich.

# 0.16.9 - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- Rate limit for the Photon API is now 1 request per second. If you host your own Photon API instance, reverse geocoding requests will not be limited.
- Requests to the Photon API are now have User-Agent header set to "Dawarich #{APP_VERSION} (https://dawarich.app)"

# 0.16.8 - 2024-11-20

### Changed

- Default number of Puma workers is now 2 instead of 1. This should improve the performance of the application. If you have a lot of users, you might want to increase the number of workers. You can do this by setting the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` env var in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Example:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      ...
      WEB_CONCURRENCY: "2"
```

# 0.16.7 - 2024-11-20

### Changed

- Prometheus exporter is now bound to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost
- `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_HOST` and `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT` env vars were added to the `docker-compose.yml` file to allow you to set the host and port for the Prometheus exporter. They should be added to both `dawarich_app` and `dawarich_sidekiq` services Example:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      ...
      PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED: "true"
+     PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_HOST: 0.0.0.0
+     PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT: "9394"

  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    environment:
      ...
      PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED: "true"
+     PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_HOST: dawarich_app
+     PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT: "9394"
```

# 0.16.6 - 2024-11-20

### Added

- Dawarich now can export metrics to Prometheus. You can find the metrics at `your.host:9394/metrics` endpoint. The metrics are being exported in the Prometheus format and can be scraped by Prometheus server. To enable exporting, set the `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED` env var in your docker-compose.yml to `true`. Example:

```yaml
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      ...
      PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_ENABLED: "true"
```

# 0.16.5 - 2024-11-18

### Changed

- Dawarich now uses `POST /api/search/metadata` endpoint to get geodata from Immich.

# 0.16.4 - 2024-11-12

### Added

- Admins can now see all users in the system on the Users page. The path is `/settings/users`.

### Changed

- Admins can now provide custom password for new users and update passwords for existing users on the Users page.
- The `bin/dev` file will no longer run `bin/rails tailwindcss:watch` command. It's useful only for development and doesn't really make sense to run it in production.

### Fixed

- Exported files will now always have an extension when downloaded. Previously, the extension was missing in case of GPX export.
- Deleting and sorting points on the Points page will now preserve filtering and sorting params when points are deleted or sorted. Previously, the page was being reloaded and filtering and sorting params were lost.

# 0.16.3 - 2024-11-10

### Fixed

- Make ActionCable respect REDIS_URL env var. Previously, ActionCable was trying to connect to Redis on localhost.

# 0.16.2 - 2024-11-08

### Fixed

- Exported GPX file now being correctly recognized as valid by Garmin Connect, Adobe Lightroom and (probably) other services. Previously, the exported GPX file was not being recognized as valid by these services.

# 0.16.1 - 2024-11-08

### Fixed

- Speed is now being recorded into points when a GPX file is being imported. Previously, the speed was not being recorded.
- GeoJSON file from GPSLogger now can be imported to Dawarich. Previously, the import was failing due to incorrect parsing of the file.

### Changed

- The Vists suggestion job is disabled. It will be re-enabled in the future with a new approach to the visit suggestion process.

# 0.16.0 - 2024-11-07

## The Websockets release

### Added

- New notifications are now being indicated with a blue-ish dot in the top right corner of the screen. Hovering over the bell icon will show you last 10 notifications.
- New points on the map will now be shown in real-time. No need to reload the map to see new points.
- User can now enable or disable Live Mode in the map controls. When Live Mode is enabled, the map will automatically scroll to the new points as they are being added to the map.

### Changed

- Scale on the map now shows the distance both in kilometers and miles.

# 0.15.13 - 2024-11-01

### Added

- `GET /api/v1/countries/borders` endpoint to get countries for scratch map feature

# 0.15.12 - 2024-11-01

### Added

- Scratch map. You can enable it in the map controls. The scratch map highlight countries you've visited. The scratch map is working properly only if you have your points reverse geocoded.

# 0.15.11 - 2024-10-29

### Added

- Importing Immich data on the Imports page now will trigger an attempt to write raw json file with the data from Immich to `tmp/imports/immich_raw_data_CURRENT_TIME_USER_EMAIL.json` file. This is useful to debug the problem with the import if it fails. #270

### Fixed

- New app version is now being checked every 6 hours instead of 1 day and the check is being performed in the background. #238

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The instruction to import `Records.json` from Google Takeout now mentions `tmp/imports` directory instead of `public/imports`. ‚ö†Ô∏è #326
- Hostname definition for Sidekiq healtcheck to solve #344. See the diff:

```diff
  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    healthcheck:
-     test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "bundle exec sidekiqmon processes | grep $(hostname)" ]
+     test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "bundle exec sidekiqmon processes | grep ${HOSTNAME}" ]
```

- Renamed directories used by app and sidekiq containers for gems cache to fix #339:

```diff
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
-     - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
+     - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems_app

...

  dawarich_sidekiq:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
-     - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
+     - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems_sidekiq
```

# 0.15.10 - 2024-10-25

### Fixed

- Data migration that prevented the application from starting.

# 0.15.9 - 2024-10-24

### Fixed

- Stats distance calculation now correctly calculates the daily distances.

### Changed

- Refactored the stats calculation process to make it more efficient.

# 0.15.8 - 2024-10-22

### Added

- User can now select between "Raw" and "Simplified" mode in the map controls. "Simplified" mode will show less points, improving the map performance. "Raw" mode will show all points.

# 0.15.7 - 2024-10-19

### Fixed

- A bug where "RuntimeError: failed to get urandom" was being raised upon importing attempt on Synology.

# 0.15.6 - 2024-10-19

### Fixed

- Import of Owntracks' .rec files now correctly imports points. Previously, the import was failing due to incorrect parsing of the file.

# 0.15.5 - 2024-10-16

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Google Takeout import was failing due to unsupported date format with milliseconds in the file.
- Fixed a bug that prevented using the Photon API host with http protocol. Now you can use both http and https protocols for the Photon API host. You now need to explicitly provide `PHOTON_API_USE_HTTPS` to be `true` or `false` depending on what protocol you want to use. [Example](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L116-L117) is in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Changed

- The Map page now by default uses timeframe based on last point tracked instead of the today's points. If there are no points, the map will use the today's timeframe.
- The map on the Map page can no longer be infinitely scrolled horizontally. #299

# 0.15.4 - 2024-10-15

### Changed

- Use static version of `geocoder` library that supports http and https for Photon API host. This is a temporary solution until the change is available in a stable release.

### Added

- Owntracks' .rec files now can be imported to Dawarich. The import process is the same as for other kinds of files, just select the .rec file and choose "owntracks" as a source.

### Removed

- Owntracks' .json files are no longer supported for import as Owntracks itself does not export to this format anymore.

# 0.15.3 - 2024-10-05

To expose the watcher functionality to the user, a new directory `/tmp/imports/watched/` was created. Add new volume to the `docker-compose.yml` file to expose this directory to the host machine.

```diff
  ...

  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    volumes:
      - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
      - public:/var/app/public
+     - watched:/var/app/tmp/watched

  ...

  dawarich_sidekiq:
      image: freikin/dawarich:latest
      container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
      volumes:
        - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
        - public:/var/app/public
+       - watched:/var/app/tmp/watched

    ...

volumes:
  db_data:
  gem_cache:
  shared_data:
  public:
+ watched:
```

### Changed

- Watcher now looks into `/tmp/imports/watched/USER@EMAIL.TLD` directory instead of `/tmp/imports/watched/` to allow using arbitrary file names for imports

# 0.15.1 - 2024-10-04

### Added

- `linux/arm/v7` is added to the list of supported architectures to support Raspberry Pi 4 and other ARMv7 devices

# 0.15.0 - 2024-10-03

## The Watcher release

The /public/imporst/watched/ directory is watched by Dawarich. Any files you put in this directory will be imported into the database. The name of the file must start with an email of the user you want to import the file for. The email must be followed by an underscore symbol (_) and the name of the file.

For example, if you want to import a file for the user with the email address "email@dawarich.app", you would name the file "email@dawarich.app_2024-05-01_2024-05-31.gpx". The file will be imported into the database and the user will receive a notification in the app.

Both GeoJSON and GPX files are supported.


### Added

- You can now put your GPX and GeoJSON files to `tmp/imports/watched` directory and Dawarich will automatically import them. This is useful if you have a service that can put files to the directory automatically. The directory is being watched every 60 minutes for new files.

### Changed

- Monkey patch for Geocoder to support http along with https for Photon API host was removed becausee it was breaking the reverse geocoding process. Now you can use only https for the Photon API host. This might be changed in the future
- Disable retries for some background jobs

### Fixed

- Stats update is now being correctly triggered every 6 hours

# [0.14.7] - 2024-10-01

### Fixed

- Now you can use http protocol for the Photon API host if you don't have SSL certificate for it
- For stats, total distance per month might have been not equal to the sum of distances per day. Now it's fixed and values are equal
- Mobile view of the map looks better now


### Changed

- `GET /api/v1/points` can now accept optional `?order=asc` query parameter to return points in ascending order by timestamp. `?order=desc` is still available to return points in descending order by timestamp
- `GET /api/v1/points` now returns `id` attribute for each point

# [0.14.6] - 2024-29-30

### Fixed

- Points imported from Google Location History (mobile devise) now have correct timestamps

### Changed

- `GET /api/v1/points?slim=true` now returns `id` attribute for each point

# [0.14.5] - 2024-09-28

### Fixed

- GPX export now finishes correctly and does not throw an error in the end
- Deleting points from the Points page now preserves `start_at` and `end_at` values for the routes. #261
- Visits map now being rendered correctly in the Visits page. #262
- Fixed issue with timezones for negative UTC offsets. #194, #122
- Point page is no longer reloads losing provided timestamps when searching for points on Points page. #283

### Changed

- Map layers from Stadia were disabled for now due to necessary API key

# [0.14.4] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed

- GPX export now has time and elevation elements for each point

### Changed

- `GET /api/v1/points` will no longer return `raw_data` attribute for each point as it's a bit too much

## [0.13.0] ‚Äî 2024-09-03

The GPX and GeoJSON export release

‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES: ‚ö†Ô∏è

Default exporting format is now GeoJSON instead of Owntracks-like JSON. This will allow you to use the exported data in other applications that support GeoJSON format. It's also important to highlight, that GeoJSON format does not describe a way to store any time-related data. Dawarich relies on the `timestamp` field in the GeoJSON format to determine the time of the point. The value of the `timestamp` field should be a Unix timestamp in seconds. If you import GeoJSON data that does not have a `timestamp` field, the point will not be imported.

Example of a valid point in GeoJSON format:

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [13.350110811262352, 52.51450815]
  },
  "properties": {
    "timestamp": 1725310036
  }
}
```

### Added

- GeoJSON format is now available for exporting data.
- GPX format is now available for exporting data.
- Importing GeoJSON is now available.

### Changed

- Default exporting format is now GeoJSON instead of Owntracks-like JSON. This will allow you to use the exported data in other applications that support GeoJSON format.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the confirmation alert was shown more than once when deleting a point.


## [0.12.3] ‚Äî 2024-09-02

### Added

- Resource limits to docke-compose.yml file to prevent server overload. Feel free to adjust the limits to your needs.

```yml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '0.50'    # Limit CPU usage to 50% of one core
      memory: '2G'    # Limit memory usage to 2GB
```

### Fixed

- Importing geodata from Immich will now not throw an error in the end of the process

### Changed

- A notification about an existing import with the same name will now show the import name

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that prevented data migration from working correctly

## [0.12.0] ‚Äî 2024-08-25

### The visit suggestion release

1. With this release deployment, data migration will work, starting visits suggestion process for all users.
2. After initial visit suggestion process, new suggestions will be calculated every 24 hours, based on points for last 24 hours.
3. If you have enabled reverse geocoding and (optionally) provided Photon Api Host, Dawarich will try to reverse geocode your visit and suggest specific places you might have visited, such as cafes, restaurants, parks, etc. If reverse geocoding is not enabled, or Photon Api Host is not provided, Dawarich will not try to suggest places but you'll be able to rename the visit yourself.
4. You can confirm or decline the visit suggestion. If you confirm the visit, it will be added to your timeline. If you decline the visit, it will be removed from your timeline. You'll be able to see all your confirmed, declined and suggested visits on the Visits page.


### Added

- A "Map" button to each visit on the Visits page to allow user to see the visit on the map
- Visits suggestion functionality. Read more on that in the release description
- Click on the visit name allows user to rename the visit
- Tabs to the Visits page to allow user to switch between confirmed, declined and suggested visits

Example: `/api/v1/points?per_page=50` will return 50 points. Also, `page` query parameter is now available to paginate the results. Example: `/api/v1/points?per_page=50&page=2` will return the second page of 50 points.

## [0.11.0] ‚Äî 2024-08-21

### Added

- A user can now trigger the import of their geodata from Immich to Dawarich by clicking the "Import Immich data" button in the Imports page.
- A user can now provide a url and an api key for their Immich instance and then trigger the import of their geodata from Immich to Dawarich. This can be done in the Settings page.

### Changed

- Table columns on the Exports page were reordered to make it more user-friendly.
- Exports are now being named with this pattern: "export_from_dd.mm.yyyy_to_dd.mm.yyyy.json" where "dd.mm.yyyy" is the date range of the export.
- Notification about any error now will include the stacktrace.

## [0.10.0] ‚Äî 2024-08-20

---

## [0.9.5] ‚Äî 2024-07-27

### Added

- A possibility to create areas. To create an area, click on the Areas checkbox in map controls (top right corner of the map), then in the top left corner of the map, click on a small circle icon. This will enable draw tool, allowing you to draw an area. When you finish drawing, release the mouse button, and the area will be created. Click on the area, set the name and click "Save" to save the area. You can also delete the area by clicking on the trash icon in the area popup.
- A background job to calculate your visits. This job will calculate your visits based on the areas you've created.
- Visits page. This page will show you all your visits, calculated based on the areas you've created. You can see the date and time of the visit, the area you've visited, and the duration of the visit.
- A possibility to confirm or decline a visit. When you create an area, the visit is not calculated immediately. You need to confirm or decline the visit. You can do this on the Visits page. Click on the visit, then click on the "Confirm" or "Decline" button. If you confirm the visit, it will be added to your timeline. If you decline the visit, it will be removed from your timeline.

---

## [0.9.1] ‚Äî 2024-07-12

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where total reverse geocoded points were calculated based on number of *imported* points that are reverse geocoded, not on the number of *total* reverse geocoded points.

---

## [0.9.0] ‚Äî 2024-07-12

### Added

- Background jobs page. You can find it in Settings -> Background Jobs.
- Queue clearing buttons. You can clear all jobs in the queue.
- Reverse geocoding restart button. You can restart the reverse geocoding process for all of your points.
- Reverse geocoding continue button. Click on this button will start reverse geocoding process only for points that were not processed yet.
- A lot more data is now being saved in terms of reverse geocoding process. It will be used in the future to create more insights about your data.

### Changed

- Point reference to a user is no longer optional. It should not cause any problems, but if you see any issues, please let me know.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calculation of total reverse geocoded points was changed. ‚ö†Ô∏è Previously, the reverse geocoding process was recording only country and city for each point. Now, it records all the data that was received from the reverse geocoding service. This means that the total number of reverse geocoded points will be different from the previous one. It is recommended to restart the reverse geocoding process to get this data for all your existing points. Below you can find an example of what kind of data is being saved to your Dawarich database:

```json
{
  "place_id": 127850637,
  "licence": "Data ¬© OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. http://osm.org/copyright",
  "osm_type": "way",
  "osm_id": 718035022,
  "lat": "52.51450815",
  "lon": "13.350110811262352",

  "addresstype": "historic",
  "name": "Victory Column",
  "display_name": "Victory Column, Gro√üer Stern, Botschaftsviertel, Tiergarten, Mitte, Berlin, 10785, Germany",
  "address": {
    "historic": "Victory Column",
    "road": "Gro√üer Stern",
    "neighbourhood": "Botschaftsviertel",
    "suburb": "Tiergarten",
    "borough": "Mitte",

    "13.3505485"
  ]
}
```

---

## [0.8.7] ‚Äî 2024-07-09

### Changed

- Added a logging config to the `docker-compose.yml` file to prevent logs from overflowing the disk. Now logs are being rotated and stored in the `log` folder in the root of the application. You can find usage example in the the repository's `docker-compose.yml` [file](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L50). Make sure to add this config to both `dawarich_app` and `dawarich_sidekiq` services.

```yaml
  logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "100m"
        max-file: "5"
```

### Fixed

- Visiting notifications page now marks this notifications as read

---

## [0.8.6] ‚Äî 2024-07-08

### Added

- Guide on how to setup a reverse proxy for Dawarich in the `docs/how_to_setup_reverse_proxy.md` file. This guide explains how to set up a reverse proxy for Dawarich using Nginx and Apache2.

### Removed

- `MAP_CENTER` env var from the `docker-compose.yml` file. This variable was used to set the default center of the map, but it is not needed anymore, as the map center is now hardcoded in the application. ‚ö†Ô∏è Feel free to remove this variable from your `docker-compose.yml` file. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Overland batch payload was not being processed due to missing coordinates in the payload. Now, if the coordinates are missing, the single point is skipped and the rest are being processed.

---

## [0.8.5] ‚Äî 2024-07-08

### Fixed

- Set `'localhost'` string as a default value for `APPLICATION_HOSTS` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file instead of an array. This is necessary to prevent errors when starting the application.

---

## [0.8.4] ‚Äî 2024-07-08

### Added

- Support for multiple hosts. Now you can specify the host of the application by setting the `APPLICATION_HOSTS` (note plural form) environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Example:

```yaml
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      APPLICATION_HOSTS: "yourhost.com,www.yourhost.com,127.0.0.1"
```

Note, there should be no protocol prefixes in the `APPLICATION_HOSTS` variable, only the hostnames.

‚ö†Ô∏è It would also be better to migrate your current `APPLICATION_HOST` to `APPLICATION_HOSTS` to avoid any issues in the future, as `APPLICATION_HOST` will be deprecated in the nearest future. ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Support for HTTPS. Now you can specify the protocol of the application by setting the `APPLICATION_PROTOCOL` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Default value is `http` Example:

```yaml
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      APPLICATION_PROTOCOL: "https"
```

### Fixed

- Support for a `location-history.json` file from Google Takeout. It turned out, this file could contain not only an object with location data history, but also an array of objects with location data history. Now Dawarich can handle both cases and import the data correctly.


---

## [0.8.3] ‚Äî 2024-07-03

### Added

- Notifications system. Now you will receive a notification when an import or export is finished, when stats update is completed and if any error occurs during any of these processes. Notifications are displayed in the top right corner of the screen and are stored in the database. You can see all your notifications on the Notifications page.
- Swagger API docs for `/api/v1/owntracks/points`. You can find the API docs at `/api-docs`.

---

## [0.8.2] ‚Äî 2024-06-30

### Added

- Google Takeout geodata, taken from a [mobile devise](https://support.google.com/maps/thread/264641290/export-full-location-timeline-data-in-json-or-similar-format-in-the-new-version-of-timeline?hl=en), is now fully supported and can be imported to the Dawarich. The import process is the same as for other kinds of files, just select the JSON file and choose "Google Phone Takeout" as a source.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where an imported point was not being saved to the database if a point with the same timestamp and already existed in the database even if it was other user's point.

---

## [0.8.1] ‚Äî 2024-06-30

### Added

- First user in the system can now create new users from the Settings page. This is useful for creating new users without the need to enable registrations. Default password for new users is `password`.

### Changed

- Registrations are now disabled by default. On the initial setup, a default user with email `user@domain.com` and password `password` is created. You can change the password in the Settings page.
- On the Imports page, now you can see the real number of points imported. Previously, this number might have not reflect the real number of points imported.

---

## [0.8.0] ‚Äî 2024-06-25

### Added

- New Settings page to change Dawarich settings.
- New "Fog of War" toggle on the map controls.

---

## [0.5.0] ‚Äî 2024-05-31

### Added

- New buttons to quickly move to today's, yesterday's and 7 days data on the map
- "Download JSON" button to points page
- For debugging purposes, now user can use `?meters_between_routes=500` and `?minutes_between_routes=60` query parameters to set the distance and time between routes to split them on the map. This is useful to understand why routes might not be connected on the map.
- Added scale indicator to the map

### Changed

- Removed "Your data" page as its function was replaced by "Download JSON" button on the points page
- Hovering over a route now also shows time and distance to next route as well as time and distance to previous route. This allows user to understand why routes might not be connected on the map.

---

## [0.4.3] ‚Äî 2024-05-30

### Added

- Now user can hover on a route and see when it started, when it ended and how much time it took to travel

### Fixed

- Timestamps in export form are now correctly assigned from the first and last points tracked by the user
- Routes are now being split based both on distance and time. If the time between two consecutive points is more than 60 minutes, the route is split into two separate routes. This improves visibility of the routes on the map.

---

## [0.4.2] ‚Äî 2024-05-29

### Changed

- Routes are now being split into separate one. If distance between two consecutive points is more than 500 meters, the route is split into two separate routes. This improves visibility of the routes on the map.
- Background jobs concurrency is increased from 5 to 10 to speed up the processing of the points.

### Fixed

- Point data, accepted from OwnTracks and Overland, is now being checked for duplicates. If a point with the same timestamp and coordinates already exists in the database, it will not be saved.

## [0.4.1] ‚Äî 2024-05-25

### Added

- Heatmap layer on the map to show the density of points

---

## [0.4.0] ‚Äî 2024-05-25

**BREAKING CHANGES**:

- `/api/v1/points` is still working, but will be **deprecated** in nearest future. Please use `/api/v1/owntracks/points` instead.

- Added docs on how to use the API with your api key. Refer to `/api-docs` for more information.
- `POST /api/v1/owntracks/points` endpoint.
- Points are now being attached to a user directly, so you can only see your own points and no other users of your applications can see your points.

### Changed

- `/api/v1/overland/batches` endpoint now requires an api key to be passed in the url. You can find your api key in your profile settings.
- All existing points recorded directly to the database will be attached to the user with id 1.
- All stats and maps are now being calculated and rendered based on the user's points only.
- Default `TIME_ZONE` environment variable is now set to 'UTC' in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] ‚Äî 2024-05-05

*Breaking changes:*

This release changes how Dawarich handles a city visit threshold. Previously, the `MINIMUM_POINTS_IN_CITY` environment variable was used to determine the minimum *number of points* in a city to consider it as visited. Now, the `MIN_MINUTES_SPENT_IN_CITY` environment variable is used to determine the minimum *minutes* between two points to consider them as visited the same city.

The logic behind this is the following: if you have a lot of points in a city, it doesn't mean you've spent a lot of time there, especially if your OwnTracks app was in "Move" mode. So, it's better to consider the time spent in a city rather than the number of points.

In your docker-compose.yml file, you need to replace the `MINIMUM_POINTS_IN_CITY` environment variable with `MIN_MINUTES_SPENT_IN_CITY`. The default value is `60`, in minutes.
