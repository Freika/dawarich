## [0.9.8] — 2024-07-27

### Fixed

- Call to the background job to calculate visits

---

## [0.9.7] — 2024-07-27

### Fixed

- Name of background job to calculate visits

---

## [0.9.6] — 2024-07-27

### Fixed

- Map areas functionality

---

## [0.9.5] — 2024-07-27

### Added

- A possibility to create areas. To create an area, click on the Areas checkbox in map controls (top right corner of the map), then in the top left corner of the map, click on a small circle icon. This will enable draw tool, allowing you to draw an area. When you finish drawing, release the mouse button, and the area will be created. Click on the area, set the name and click "Save" to save the area. You can also delete the area by clicking on the trash icon in the area popup.
- A background job to calculate your visits. This job will calculate your visits based on the areas you've created.
- Visits page. This page will show you all your visits, calculated based on the areas you've created. You can see the date and time of the visit, the area you've visited, and the duration of the visit.
- A possibility to confirm or decline a visit. When you create an area, the visit is not calculated immediately. You need to confirm or decline the visit. You can do this on the Visits page. Click on the visit, then click on the "Confirm" or "Decline" button. If you confirm the visit, it will be added to your timeline. If you decline the visit, it will be removed from your timeline.
- Settings for visit calculation. You can set the minimum time spent in the area to consider it as a visit. This setting can be found in the Settings page.
- POST `/api/v1/areas` and GET `/api/v1/areas` endpoints. You can now create and list your areas via the API.

⚠️ Visits functionality is still in beta. If you find any issues, please let me know. ⚠️

### Fixed

- A route popup now correctly shows distance made in the route, not the distance between first and last points in the route.

---

## [0.9.4] — 2024-07-21

### Added

- A popup being shown when user clicks on a point now contains a link to delete the point. This is useful if you want to delete a point that was imported by mistake or you just want to clean up your data.

### Fixed

- Added `public/imports` and `public/exports` folders to git to prevent errors when exporting data

### Changed

- Some code from `maps_controller.js` was extracted into separate files

---


## [0.9.3] — 2024-07-19

### Added

- Admin flag to the database. Now not only the first user in the system can create new users, but also users with the admin flag set to true. This will make easier introduction of more admin functions in the future.

### Fixed

- Route hover distance is now being rendered in kilometers, not in meters, if route distance is more than 1 km.

---

## [0.9.2] — 2024-07-19

### Fixed

- Hover over a route does not move map anymore and shows the route tooltip where user hovers over the route, not at the end of the route. Click on route now will move the map to include the whole route.

---

## [0.9.1] — 2024-07-12

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where total reverse geocoded points were calculated based on number of *imported* points that are reverse geocoded, not on the number of *total* reverse geocoded points.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2024-07-12

### Added

- Background jobs page. You can find it in Settings -> Backgroun Jobs.
- Queue clearing buttons. You can clear all jobs in the queue.
- Reverse geocoding restart button. You can restart the reverse geocoding process for all of your points.
- Reverse geocoding continue button. Click on this button will start reverse geocoding process only for points that were not processed yet.
- A lot more data is now being saved in terms of reverse geocoding process. It will be used in the future to create more insights about your data.

### Changed

- Point reference to a user is no longer optional. It should not cause any problems, but if you see any issues, please let me know.
- ⚠️ Calculation of total reverse geocoded points was changed. ⚠️ Previously, the reverse geocoding process was recording only country and city for each point. Now, it records all the data that was received from the reverse geocoding service. This means that the total number of reverse geocoded points will be different from the previous one. It is recommended to restart the reverse geocoding process to get this data for all your existing points. Below you can find an example of what kind of data is being saved to your Dawarich database:

```json
{
  "place_id": 127850637,
  "licence": "Data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. http://osm.org/copyright",
  "osm_type": "way",

  ]
}
```

---

## [0.8.7] — 2024-07-09

### Changed

- Added a logging config to the `docker-compose.yml` file to prevent logs from overflowing the disk. Now logs are being rotated and stored in the `log` folder in the root of the application. You can find usage example in the the repository's `docker-compose.yml` [file](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L50). Make sure to add this config to both `dawarich_app` and `dawarich_sidekiq` services.

```yaml
  logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "100m"
        max-file: "5"
```

### Fixed

- Visiting notifications page now marks this notifications as read

---

## [0.8.6] — 2024-07-08

### Added

- Guide on how to setup a reverse proxy for Dawarich in the `docs/how_to_setup_reverse_proxy.md` file. This guide explains how to set up a reverse proxy for Dawarich using Nginx and Apache2.

### Removed

- `MAP_CENTER` env var from the `docker-compose.yml` file. This variable was used to set the default center of the map, but it is not needed anymore, as the map center is now hardcoded in the application. ⚠️ Feel free to remove this variable from your `docker-compose.yml` file. ⚠️

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Overland batch payload was not being processed due to missing coordinates in the payload. Now, if the coordinates are missing, the single point is skipped and the rest are being processed.

---

## [0.8.5] — 2024-07-08

### Fixed

- Set `'localhost'` string as a default value for `APPLICATION_HOSTS` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file instead of an array. This is necessary to prevent errors when starting the application.

---

## [0.8.4] — 2024-07-08

### Added

- Support for multiple hosts. Now you can specify the host of the application by setting the `APPLICATION_HOSTS` (note plural form) environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Example:

```yaml
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      APPLICATION_HOSTS: "yourhost.com,www.yourhost.com,127.0.0.1"
```

Note, there should be no protocol prefixes in the `APPLICATION_HOSTS` variable, only the hostnames.

⚠️ It would also be better to migrate your current `APPLICATION_HOST` to `APPLICATION_HOSTS` to avoid any issues in the future, as `APPLICATION_HOST` will be deprecated in the nearest future. ⚠️

- Support for HTTPS. Now you can specify the protocol of the application by setting the `APPLICATION_PROTOCOL` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Default value is `http` Example:

```yaml
  dawarich_app:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_app
    environment:
      APPLICATION_PROTOCOL: "https"
```

### Fixed

- Support for a `location-history.json` file from Google Takeout. It turned out, this file could contain not only an object with location data history, but also an array of objets with location data history. Now Dawarich can handle both cases and import the data correctly.


---

## [0.8.3] — 2024-07-03

### Added

- Notifications system. Now you will receive a notification when an import or export is finished, when stats update is completed and if any error occurs during any of these processes. Notifications are displayed in the top right corner of the screen and are stored in the database. You can see all your notifications on the Notifications page.
- Swagger API docs for `/api/v1/owntracks/points`. You can find the API docs at `/api-docs`.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2024-06-30

### Added

- Google Takeout geodata, taken from a [mobile devise](https://support.google.com/maps/thread/264641290/export-full-location-timeline-data-in-json-or-similar-format-in-the-new-version-of-timeline?hl=en), is now fully supported and can be imported to the Dawarich. The import process is the same as for other kinds of files, just select the JSON file and choose "Google Phone Takeout" as a source.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where an imported point was not being saved to the database if a point with the same timestamp and already existed in the database even if it was other user's point.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2024-06-30

### Added

- First user in the system can now create new users from the Settings page. This is useful for creating new users without the need to enable registrations. Default password for new users is `password`.

### Changed

- Registrations are now disabled by default. On the initial setup, a default user with email `user@domain.com` and password `password` is created. You can change the password in the Settings page.
- On the Imports page, now you can see the real number of points imported. Previously, this number might have not reflect the real number of points imported.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2024-06-25

### Added

- New Settings page to change Dawarich settings.
- New "Fog of War" toggle on the map controls.
- New "Fog of War meters" field in Settings. This field allows you to set the radius in meters around the point to be shown on the map. The map outside of this radius will be covered with a fog of war.

### Changed

- Order of points on Points page is now descending by timestamp instead of ascending.

---

## [0.7.1] — 2024-06-20

In new Settings page you can now change the following settings:

- Maximum distance between two points to consider them as one route
- Maximum time between two points to consider them as one route

### Added

## [0.7.0] — 2024-06-19

## The GPX MVP Release

This release introduces support for GPX files to be imported. Now you can import GPX files from your devices to Dawarich. The import process is the same as for other kinds of files, just select the GPX file instead and choose "gpx" as a source. Both single-segmented and multi-segmented GPX files are supported.

⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES: ⚠️

- `/api/v1/points` endpoint is removed. Please use `/api/v1/owntracks/points` endpoint to upload your points from OwnTracks mobile app instead.

### Added

- Support for GPX files to be imported.

### Changed

- Couple of unnecessary params were hidden from route popup and now can be shown using `?debug=true` query parameter. This is useful for debugging purposes.

## [0.5.3] — 2024-06-10

### Added

- A data migration to remove points with 0.0, 0.0 coordinates. This is necessary to prevent errors when calculating distance in Stats page.

### Fixed

- Reworked code responsible for importing "Records.json" file from Google Takeout. Now it is more reliable and faster, and should not throw as many errors as before.

---

## [0.5.2] — 2024-06-08

### Added

- "Download JSON" button to points page
- For debugging purposes, now user can use `?meters_between_routes=500` and `?minutes_between_routes=60` query parameters to set the distance and time between routes to split them on the map. This is useful to understand why routes might not be connected on the map.
- Added scale indicator to the map

### Changed

- Removed "Your data" page as its function was replaced by "Download JSON" button on the points page
- Hovering over a route now also shows time and distance to next route as well as time and distance to previous route. This allows user to understand why routes might not be connected on the map.

---

## [0.4.3] — 2024-05-30

### Added

- Now user can hover on a route and see when it started, when it ended and how much time it took to travel

### Fixed

- Timestamps in export form are now correctly assigned from the first and last points tracked by the user
- Routes are now being split based both on distance and time. If the time between two consecutive points is more than 60 minutes, the route is split into two separate routes. This improves visibility of the routes on the map.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2024-05-29

### Changed

- Routes are now being split into separate one. If distance between two consecutive points is more than 500 meters, the route is split into two separate routes. This improves visibility of the routes on the map.
- Background jobs concurrency is increased from 5 to 10 to speed up the processing of the points.

### Fixed

- Point data, accepted from OwnTracks and Overland, is now being checked for duplicates. If a point with the same timestamp and coordinates already exists in the database, it will not be saved.

### Added

- Heatmap layer on the map to show the density of points

---

## [0.4.0] — 2024-05-25

### Added

- Each user now have an api key, which is required to make requests to the API. You can find your api key in your profile settings.
- You can re-generate your api key in your profile settings.
- In your user profile settings you can now see the instructions on how to use the API with your api key for both OwnTracks and Overland.
- Added docs on how to use the API with your api key. Refer to `/api-docs` for more information.
- `POST /api/v1/owntracks/points` endpoint.
- Points are now being attached to a user directly, so you can only see your own points and no other users of your applications can see your points.

### Fixed

- Dark/light theme switcher in navbar is now being saved in user settings, so it persists between sessions

---

## [0.2.0] — 2024-05-05

*Breaking changes:*

This release changes how Dawarich handles a city visit threshold. Previously, the `MINIMUM_POINTS_IN_CITY` environment variable was used to determine the minimum *number of points* in a city to consider it as visited. Now, the `MIN_MINUTES_SPENT_IN_CITY` environment variable is used to determine the minimum *minutes* between two points to consider them as visited the same city.

The logic behind this is the following: if you have a lot of points in a city, it doesn't mean you've spent a lot of time there, especially if your OwnTracks app was in "Move" mode. So, it's better to consider the time spent in a city rather than the number of points.

In your docker-compose.yml file, you need to replace the `MINIMUM_POINTS_IN_CITY` environment variable with `MIN_MINUTES_SPENT_IN_CITY`. The default value is `60`, in minutes.
