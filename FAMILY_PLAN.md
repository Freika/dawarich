## Overview

The Family Plan feature allows Dawarich users to create family groups, invite members, and share their latest location data within the family. This feature enhances the social aspect of location tracking while maintaining strong privacy controls.

### Key Features
- Create and manage family groups
- Invite members via email
- Share latest location data within family
- Role-based permissions (owner/member)
- Privacy controls for location sharing
- Email notifications and in-app notifications

### Business Rules
- Maximum 5 family members per family (hardcoded constant)
- One family per user (must leave current family to join another)
- Family owners cannot delete their accounts
- Invitation tokens expire after 7 days
- Only latest position sharing (no historical data access)
- Free for self-hosted instances, paid feature for Dawarich Cloud

## Database Schema

### 1. Families Table
- `id` (bigint, primary key)
- `name` (string, max 50 chars, not null)
- `creator_id` (bigint, foreign key to users, not null)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (datetime)
- **Constant**: MAX_MEMBERS = 5

### 2. Family Memberships Table
- `id` (bigint, primary key)
- `family_id` (bigint, foreign key to families, not null)
- `user_id` (bigint, foreign key to users, not null, unique - one family per user)
- `role` (integer enum: owner=0, member=1, not null, default: member)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (datetime)

### 3. Family Invitations Table
- `id` (bigint, primary key)
- `family_id` (bigint, foreign key to families, not null)
- `email` (string, not null, validated format)
- `token` (string, not null, unique - secure invitation token)
- `expires_at` (datetime, not null - 7 days from creation)
- `invited_by_id` (bigint, foreign key to users, not null)
- `status` (integer enum: pending=0, accepted=1, expired=2, cancelled=3)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (datetime)

### 4. User Model Extensions
Added associations and helper methods:
- `in_family?` - Check if user is in a family
- `family_owner?` - Check if user owns their family
- `can_delete_account?` - Prevents owners from deleting accounts with members

## Core Architecture

### Service Classes
All family operations use service objects for business logic:

**Families::Create**
- Creates family with automatic owner membership
- Validates user eligibility (not already in family)
- Sends notification to creator

**Families::Invite**
- Sends email invitations with secure tokens
- Validates family capacity (max 5 members)
- Prevents duplicate invitations
- Checks invitee isn't already in a family

**Families::AcceptInvitation**
- Validates invitation status and email match
- Creates member membership
- Updates invitation status
- Notifies both user and family owner

**Families::Leave**
- Removes user from family
- Prevents owners from leaving with active members
- Handles ownership transfer logic
- Cleans up family if last member leaves

**Families::LocationSharingService**
- Retrieves latest location for each family member
- Powers family map visualization
- Returns location data with timestamps

### Controllers
**FamiliesController** - Family CRUD operations and dashboard
**FamilyMembershipsController** - Member management
**FamilyInvitationsController** - Invitation creation and acceptance
**Users::SessionsController** - Custom login flow with invitation tokens

### Authorization
Three Pundit policies control access:
- **FamilyPolicy** - Family operations (create, update, destroy, invite)
- **FamilyMembershipPolicy** - Member management
- **FamilyInvitationPolicy** - Invitation management

### Email System
**FamilyMailer** sends invitation emails with:
- Personalized invitation message
- Family name and inviter information
- Benefits explanation
- Accept invitation link
- 7-day expiration notice

## Error Handling

Services return `true`/`false` and expose `error_message` for user-friendly feedback:
- All database operations use transactions with rollback
- Comprehensive validation with specific error messages
- Controllers display service error messages to users
- Common errors: capacity limits, duplicate invitations, permission issues

## Routes Summary

Nested resources under families:
```ruby
resources :families do
  member do
    delete :leave
    patch :update_location_sharing
  end
  resources :invitations, except: %i[edit update], controller: 'family_invitations' do
    member do
      post :accept
    end
  end
  resources :members, only: %i[index show destroy], controller: 'family_memberships'
end

# Public family invitation acceptance (no auth required)
get 'invitations/:id', to: 'family_invitations#show', as: :public_invitation
```

Custom Devise routes for invitation flow:
```ruby
devise_for :users, controllers: {
  registrations: 'users/registrations',
  sessions: 'users/sessions'
}
```

API routes for family locations:
```ruby
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    resources :families, only: [] do
      collection do
        get :locations
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token-based Invitations** - Secure, unguessable tokens with 7-day expiry
2. **Sequential IDs** - Standard bigint primary keys for performance
3. **Authorization Policies** - Comprehensive Pundit policies for all actions
4. **Data Privacy** - Users control location sharing settings
5. **Account Protection** - Owners cannot delete accounts with active members
6. **Email Validation** - Proper format validation for invitations

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes** - Proper indexing on foreign keys and common queries
2. **Eager Loading** - Use `includes()` for associations
3. **Caching** - Family locations cached for map display
4. **Background Jobs** - Sidekiq for email sending
5. **Transaction Safety** - All operations wrapped in database transactions
